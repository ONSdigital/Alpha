              <h4> Abstract </h4>
              <p>The key economic stories from National Statistics produced over the latest month, painting a coherent picture of the UK economic performance using recent economic data.
              </p>
              <p>
                The preliminary estimate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) indicated that the UK economy continued to grow in the first three months of 2014. Output grew by 0.8% in Q1 2014, following growth of 0.8% and 0.7% in Q3 and Q4 2013 respectively. Output is now 3.1% higher than the same period a year ago and while GDP remains 0.6% below its pre-downturn peak, the pace of annual growth is now faster than at any point since the onset of the economic downturn. Excluding oil &amp; gas production, Gross Value Added (GVA) in the UK surpassed its pre-downturn peak in Q1 2014.

            <h3><a name = "1">Introduction</a></h3>
            <p>This article outlines a first draft set of 29 headline measures of young people's well-being and the reasons for their selection across seven of the ten domains used in the national set. These domains are Personal Well-being, Our Relationships, Health, What We Do, Where We Live, Personal Finance and Education &amp; Skills. The remaining three domains (Governance, Natural Environment and Economy) are more relevant to all age groups and have not been included here.
            </p>
            <p>The full list of headline measures can be found in the <a href="#" title="RFT Young people's well-being proposed measures">data section</a> of this article. Other potential measures have been included which reflect possible additional or alternatives to the proposed headline measures.
            </p>
            <p>Findings from the MNW Children and Young People's project have been used to inform this work. Where new measures have been proposed, the <a href="#">criteria to determine the original set of broader measures</a> have been used. As outlined in the criteria, UK data has been used where available; in cases where there is not a measure for the UK, England or England and Wales has been used.
            </p>
            <h4>Why measure young people's well-being?</h4>
            <p>There were around 7.5 million young people aged 16 to 24 in the UK in 2010 according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) mid-year population estimates (ONS, 2013a). This age is important as it is a time of transition from childhood to adulthood, and the ways in which this transition is negotiated may affect well-being. Arnett (2004) coined the phrase 'emerging adulthood' to describe this stage of life. He explained how it is different from 'late adolescence' as it is a period of life "much freer from parental control [and] much more a period of independent exploration". Furthermore, Arnett argues this period of life is different from 'young adulthood' as many 18-24 year olds have yet to make "the transitions historically associated with adult status" such as marriage and parenthood. </p>

            <p>An important component of national well-being is the subjective well-being of all individuals, including young people. It is measured by finding out how people think and feel about their own lives. Subjective well-being measures are grounded in individuals' preferences and take account of what matters to people by allowing them to decide what is important. By looking at young people as a separate sub-group, we can see if they differ from the general population. While subjective well-being is important, it is just one component of national well-being.</p>

            <h4>Personal Well-being</h4>
            <p>Since April 2011, the Annual Population Survey, which samples people from age 16, has included four questions which are used to monitor personal wellbeing in the UK:</p>
            <ol><li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?</li>
              <li>Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?</li>
              <li>Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?</li>
              <li>Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?</li></p>
            </ol>
            <p>Responses are on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is 'not at all' and 10 is 'completely'. Higher levels of personal well-being for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness are defined as 7 or more out of 10. However, for anxiety 3 or less out of 10 is used because lower levels of anxiety indicate better personal well-being.
            </p>
            <p>Young people are more likely to report higher levels of satisfaction with their life and lower levels of anxiety compared with all adults. This may relate to the increase in freedom, independence and self-focus associated with the 'emerging adulthood' lifestage. Similar proportions of young people have higher levels of happiness yesterday and feel that the things they do are worthwhile as all adults.
            </p>

This was developed to measure the mental well-being of populations and groups over time. As such, we can compare young people as a sub-group with the general population. The SWEMWBS provides a mean score (out of 35) of mental well-being for the population and changes over time can be assessed by examining differences in the mean score; however, it cannot be used to categorise good, average or poor mental well-being<a href = "#21"><sup>1</sup></a>.

While subjective well-being is important, it is just one component of national well-being.</p>

            <h4>What We Do</h4>
            <p>Since April 2011, the Annual Population Survey, which samples people from age 16, has included four questions which are used to monitor personal wellbeing in the UK:</p>
            <ol><li>Overall, how satisfied are you with your life nowadays?</li>
              <li>Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?</li>
              <li>Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?</li>
              <li>Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?</li></p>
            </ol>
            <p>Responses are on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is 'not at all' and 10 is 'completely'. Higher levels of personal well-being for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness are defined as 7 or more out of 10. However, for anxiety 3 or less out of 10 is used because lower levels of anxiety indicate better personal well-being.
            </p>
            <p>Young people are more likely to report higher levels of satisfaction with their life and lower levels of anxiety compared with all adults. This may relate to the increase in freedom, independence and self-focus associated with the 'emerging adulthood' lifestage. Similar proportions of young people have higher levels of happiness yesterday and feel that the things they do are worthwhile as all adults.
            </p>
            <h4>Mental Well-being</h4>
            <p>The mental well-being measure is the shortened version of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). This was developed to measure the mental well-being of populations and groups over time. As such, we can compare young people as a sub-group with the general population. The SWEMWBS provides a mean score (out of 35) of mental well-being for the population and changes over time can be assessed by examining differences in the mean score; however, it cannot be used to categorise good, average or poor mental well-being<a href = "#21"><sup>1</sup></a>. "WEMWBS has been validated for use in the UK with those aged 16 and above. Validation involved both student and general population samples, and focus groups"  (Health Scotland). </p></p>

              <li>Overall, to what extent do you feel the things you do in your life are worthwhile?</li>
              <li>Overall, how happy did you feel yesterday?</li>
              <li>Overall, how anxious did you feel yesterday?</li></p>
            </ol>
            <p>Responses are on a scale of 0 to 10 where 0 is 'not at all' and 10 is 'completely'. Higher levels of personal well-being for life satisfaction, worthwhile and happiness are defined as 7 or more out of 10. However, for anxiety 3 or less out of 10 is used because lower levels of anxiety indicate better personal well-being.
            </p>
            <p>Young people are more likely to report higher levels of satisfaction with their life and lower levels of anxiety compared with all adults. This may relate to the increase in freedom, independence and self-focus associated with the 'emerging adulthood' lifestage. Similar proportions of young people have higher levels of happiness yesterday and feel that the things they do are worthwhile as all adults.
            </p>
            <h4>Mental Well-being</h4>
            <p>The mental well-being measure is the shortened version of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale (SWEMWBS). This was developed to measure the mental well-being of populations and groups over time. As such, we can compare young people as a sub-group with the general population. The SWEMWBS provides a mean score (out of 35) of mental well-being for the population and changes over time can be assessed by examining differences in the mean score; however, it cannot be used to categorise good, average or poor mental well-being<a href = "#21"><sup>1</sup></a>. "WEMWBS has been validated for use in the UK with those aged 16 and above. Validation involved both student and general population samples, and focus groups"  (Health Scotland). </p></p>

              <h4>Notes for Personal Well-being</h4>
              <ol><li><p><a name = "21"> </a>As well as not being designed to identify people who have or probably have a mental illness, <a href="#">WEMWBS</a> does not have a 'cut off' level to divide the population into those who have 'good' and those who have 'poor' mental well-being in the way that scores on other mental health measures, for example the GHQ 12.</p></li></ol>
